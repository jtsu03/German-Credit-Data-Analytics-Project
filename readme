🏦 German Credit Risk Classification Using Machine Learning
Project Overview

This project applies machine learning classification models to the German Credit dataset to predict the binary target variable RESPONSE. The analysis emphasizes out-of-sample (test set) performance and compares multiple models and feature sets to understand tradeoffs between accuracy, precision, recall, and interpretability.

Two modeling approaches are evaluated:

Decision Tree Classifier

Neural Network (MLPClassifier)

Each model is trained using:

All available features

Top 5 selected features, chosen via correlation with the target variable

Objectives

Predict credit response outcomes (RESPONSE)

Compare models using test-set performance metrics

Evaluate how feature selection impacts generalization

Understand tradeoffs between recall-heavy vs balanced classifiers

Dataset

File: GermanCredit.csv

Target Variable: RESPONSE

Preprocessing Steps:

Missing values handled using forward fill

Categorical variables encoded via one-hot encoding

Cleaned dataset saved as Cleaned_GermanCredit.csv

Methodology
1. Exploratory Data Analysis

Dataset structure and summary statistics

Correlation heatmap across encoded variables

2. Feature Selection

Selected Top 5 features based on absolute correlation with RESPONSE

Visualized correlation strength using bar charts

3. Train/Test Split & Scaling

70/30 train-test split with stratification on the target

StandardScaler applied for neural network models

4. Model Training & Tuning

All models were tuned using GridSearchCV (cv = 3).

Decision Tree tuning parameters:

Criterion (gini, entropy)

Max depth

Leaf and split constraints

Neural Network tuning parameters:

Hidden layer sizes

Activation functions

Maximum iterations

Evaluation Strategy

All final results are reported on the held-out test set to measure real-world generalization.

Metrics Used

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, and F1-score

Confusion Matrices

📊 Test Set Results
Classification Performance Summary
Model	Feature Set	Accuracy	Class 1 Recall	Macro F1
Neural Network	Top 5	0.78	0.90	0.71
Decision Tree	Top 5	0.72	0.94	0.56
Neural Network	All Features	0.71	0.82	0.64
Decision Tree	All Features	0.72	0.80	0.67

Key takeaway: Feature selection significantly improved model performance, particularly for the Neural Network.

Confusion Matrix Insights (Test Data)
Decision Tree (Top 5 Features)

Extremely high recall for the positive class (0.94)

Very low recall for the negative class (0.20)

Aggressive prediction strategy with many false positives

Useful when maximizing positive detection is the priority

Neural Network (Top 5 Features)

Strong recall for the positive class (0.90)

Substantially better balance across classes

Fewer false positives and stronger true negative performance

Most stable and generalizable model overall

Final Model Interpretation

The Neural Network using the top 5 features achieved the highest test accuracy and best overall balance between precision and recall.

The Decision Tree using the top 5 features prioritized recall for the positive class at the expense of negative-class performance.

Model selection ultimately depends on whether the goal is:

Balanced classification performance → Neural Network

Maximum sensitivity to positives → Decision Tree

All conclusions are based strictly on test-set performance, not training results.
